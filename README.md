# Water-Intake-tracker
created a water intake tracker using html, css and js
The Water Intake Tracker is an interactive web-based application designed to help users monitor their daily water consumption. The project allows users to input their daily water intake goal in liters and track the amount of water they have consumed using a visual representation of a water glass. It dynamically calculates the remaining water intake required to achieve the goal and visually fills a large glass to represent progress in percentage.
